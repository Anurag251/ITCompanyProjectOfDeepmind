                You could say Scott Zoldi knows a thing or two about Responsible
                AI. As Chief Analytics Officer at FICO, a company that powers
                billions of AI-driven decisions in production, Scott has
                authored over 100 patents in areas like ethics,
                interpretability, and explainability. One of his most recent
                projects, a new industry report on Responsible AI, found that:

              <div class="desc">
                Scott identified four major components of Responsible AI:
              </div>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Robust AI:</strong> Understanding the data deeply,
                  doing stability testing, predicting causes of data drift, and
                  anticipating how the model might be used differently from its
                  original use intent.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Explainable AI:</strong> Knowing what’s driving the
                  model, both while developing it and at prediction time, in
                  order to create helpful, actionable explanations for
                  end-users.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Ethical AI:</strong> Making a concerted effort to
                  remove bias from your models: in your data and in your model’s
                  learned features.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Auditable AI:</strong> Efficiently and proactively
                  monitoring your models.
                </li>

              <div class="name">
                The challenges of implementing Responsible AI
              </div>
              <div class="desc">
                One challenge of implementing Responsible AI is the complexity
                of ML systems. “We surveyed 100 Chief Analytics Officers and
                Chief AI Officers and Chief Data Officers and about 65% said
                they can’t explain how their model behaves,” Scott said. This is
                an education problem, but it’s also due to companies using
                overly complicated models because they feel pressured to have
                the latest technology.

                <br />
                <br />
                Another challenge is the lack of monitoring. “Only 20% of these
                CIOs and Chief AI Officers are monitoring models for performance
                and ethics,” Scott said. This is due to multiple factors: Lack
                of tooling, lack of investment and company culture around
                Responsible AI, and lack of model explainability to know what to
                monitor.
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="others-infos">
              <div class="name">Strategies for implementing Responsible AI</div>
              <div class="desc">
                Practitioners should be thinking about explainability long
                before models go into production. “My focus is really on
                ensuring that when we develop models, we can understand what
                drives these models, in particular latent features,” Scott said.
                This lets teams design models that avoid exposing protected
                classes to bias, and constrain models so their behavior is
                easier for humans to understand.

                <br />
                <br />
                When models are in production, Scott explained, teams should
                know the metrics associated with their most important features
                in order to see how they’re shifting over time. Monitoring
                sub-slices or segments of the data is also essential in order to
                find outliers. And teams should set informed thresholds to know
                when to raise an alarm about data drift.

                <br />
                <br />
                Lastly, responsible AI can mean starting with a model design
                that’s simpler. Complex models are harder to explain, and are
                more prone to degradation as data drifts over time.

              <div class="desc">
                Here’s what Scott believes organizations should do going
                forward:
              </div>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong
                    >Recognize that a model development standard, set at the
                    company level, is essential.
                  </strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Explainable AI:</strong> Knowing what’s driving the
                  model, both while developing it and at prediction time, in
                  order to create helpful, actionable explanations for
                  end-users.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Commit to enforcing that standard.</strong> Document
                  your success criteria and your progress so that everyone can
                  see where the team is at. Scott’s doing research into model
                  development governance based on blockchain, so when someone
                  signs off on a model, their name goes into a permanent open
                  record.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong
                    >Focus on production and how models can provide business
                    value.</strong
                  >
                  This might require a mindset shift for data scientists. “If
                  you’re in an organization where you’re building the model, you
                  need to see yourself as part of the success of the production
                  environment,” Scott said.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <div class="desc">
                To ensure organizations act responsibly when their models affect
                customers, it’s important for AI systems to be thoughtfully
                designed and monitored. Fiddler is an end-to-end monitoring and
